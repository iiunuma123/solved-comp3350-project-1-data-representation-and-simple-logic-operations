<ul>

 <li>Get you familiar with data representation and simple logic operations for this course.</li>

</ul>

Questions:

<ol>

 <li>Convert the following unsigned base 2 numbers (binary) to base 16 numbers (hexadecimal):</li>

 <li>0110 0001 1111</li>

 <li>1000 1111 1100</li>

 <li>0001 0110 0100 0101</li>

</ol>




<ol start="2">

 <li></li>

</ol>

(2.1) Convert the following binary

<ol>

 <li>1100 1010</li>

 <li>1111 0010</li>

 <li>1000 0111</li>

</ol>

numbers into base 10 numbers (decimal), binary numbers are represented in signed magnitude representation.

<ul>

 <li>Redo the question 2.1, if the binary number are represented in One’s complement representation.</li>

 <li>Redo the question 2.1, if the binary number are represented in Two’s complement representation.</li>

</ul>

For example, question (2.1), if 1100 1010 is a binary number represented in signed magnitude representation, what is the decimal value? Also do it again if 1100 1010 is a binary number in one’s complement representation and two’s complement representation. There 9 questions in total.

(3.1) Convert the following base 10 (decimal) values to binary numbers (8-bits): a. -100d

<ol>

 <li>-16d</li>

 <li>-21d</li>

 <li>-0d</li>

</ol>

Each binary result represented in Signed magnitude representation.

<ul>

 <li>Redo the question (3.1), convert binary into in One’s complement representation.</li>

 <li>Redo the question (3.1), convert binary into in Two’s complement representation.</li>

</ul>

<ol start="4">

 <li>(4 points) What is the range of: A. An unsigned 7-bit number?</li>

 <li>A signed 7-bit number?</li>

 <li>(12 points) Provide the answer to the following problems (∧ = AND, ∨ = OR)

  <ol>

   <li>1000 ∧ 1110</li>

   <li>1000∨1110</li>

   <li>(1000∧1110) ∨ (1001∧1110)</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

<ol start="6">

 <li>Please demonstrate each step in the calculation of the arithmetic operation 25 – 65. (both 25 and 65 are signed decimal numbers)</li>

</ol>




<ol start="7">

 <li> Mathematically the answer in Q6 is -40d. Please verify your answer in Q6 using a conversion of 2’s and decimal numbers.</li>
